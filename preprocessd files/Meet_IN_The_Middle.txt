Suppose we want to find 
		
	a + b + c + d = S

A brute force method wud take N^4 comlexity , So we try  to solve (a + b ) + (c + d ) = S

that is x + y = S 

again y = S - x = Alpha

implies , produce all the x  and y values with N^2 complexity and check if there exist any common element in x and y
